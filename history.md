# Project History

## 2026-01-14 - Initial Setup

### Session 1: Project Creation
- Initialized git repository
- Created .gitignore with security rules for sensitive HR data
- Created 2025/ directory structure for performance review documents
- Created README.md with project overview and workflows
- Created CLAUDE.md for project context and memory
- Created this history.md file

**Commits:**
1. `c70e701` - Initial commit: Git configuration with security rules
2. `d7e98d1` - Add project README and 2025/ folder structure

**Structure Created:**
```
people_management/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── CLAUDE.md
├── history.md
└── 2025/
    ├── EOY performance/EOY reviews/
    ├── mid year performance/feedback documents/
    ├── Promotions/
    ├── 2025 salary increase/
    └── output/
        ├── EOY reports/
        ├── github_reports/
        └── processing_aid/
```

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Create Engineer_Tracking.md with 16 engineers
- [ ] Create PERFORMANCE_REVIEW_SOURCES.md checklist
- [ ] Create performance review template
- [ ] Set up github_tracking/ reference structure
- [ ] Document integration with existing tools

**Key Decisions:**
- Use existing tools (document-cruncher, github-muncher) rather than reimplementing
- Keep 2025/ folder gitignored to protect sensitive HR data
- Focus on coordination and documentation over complex automation
- Follow Version 3.0 format for all performance reviews
